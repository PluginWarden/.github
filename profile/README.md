# PluginWarden

We try to provide an easy to use plugin installation process as well as staying up to date with recents changes and updates. If you want to help by adding a plugin take a look into the [PluginStorage](https://github.com/PluginWarden/PluginStorage) repository and create a Pull Request there or an Issue if some plugin does not work with another or with a specific minecraft version.
